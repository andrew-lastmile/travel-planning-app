# AI Travel Planning App

An AI-assisted travel planning application that helps users plan flights and lodging within their budget.

## Features

- AI-powered travel recommendations using OpenAI GPT-4
- Budget allocation between flights and lodging
- Interactive flight and lodging selection
- Real-time budget visualization with charts and progress bars
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React with Vite
- Recharts for data visualization
- CSS3 for styling

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express
- OpenAI API for AI recommendations
- Mock data for flights and lodging

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd travel-planning-app
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PORT=3001
```

### Running Locally

1. Start the backend server (from the `backend` directory):
```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on http://localhost:3001

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend (from the `frontend` directory):
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on http://localhost:5173

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173

## Deployment to Vercel

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. Make sure all your code is committed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Push your changes to the remote repository

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in with your Git provider
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your repository
4. Configure the project:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Root Directory: `./frontend`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
5. Add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
6. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Configure Backend on Vercel

The backend is configured to run as a serverless function on Vercel. The `vercel.json` file in the root directory handles the routing between frontend and backend.

### Step 4: Update API Endpoint

After deployment, update the API endpoint in the frontend code:

In `frontend/src/components/TripPlanner.jsx`, change:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/recommendations', ...)
```

To:
```javascript
fetch('/api/recommendations', ...)
```

This will use relative URLs that work both locally (with a proxy) and in production.

### Environment Variables

Make sure to add the following environment variable in your Vercel project settings:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

- Vercel hosting: Free tier (sufficient for demo)
- Domain (optional): ~$10-15/year

Total estimated cost: ~$100-200 for development and demo
